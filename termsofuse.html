							</li>
							<li>

								18.5 You agree that if Megam.co does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Megam.co has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Megam.co’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Megam.co.
